  ## Description
  This application is a command line application, which lets users add a "manager", "engineer", and "intern" to a  software engineering team. Users can organize teams by creating profiles for their teammembers, and assign information to these teammates (objects). The application will produce a simple HTML page with all members and the associated information. This program can easily be changed to fit whatever team needs to be built.   

  ## Requirements
  This application utilizes Javascript for coding the index, libraries, HTML generation, and tests. To run the tests, the  jest dependancy will be used. The application also utilizes inquierer to function. To run the app, nodeJS is used. 

  ## Installation
  Users will copy or download the repository that this application is within. To run the application, once the downloaded folder is opened in a coding enviornment like VS Code, open the integrated terminal. Type in "npm i" to install all the dependancies. Once that is complete, users will type "node index.js" to begin using the app.

  ## Useage
  To utilize the app, once "node index.js" has been typed into the terminal, a series of prompts will be presented to the user. Upon answering all the prompts, an index.html file will be created in the "dist" folder. This html page will be filled in with answers to the user's prompts.
